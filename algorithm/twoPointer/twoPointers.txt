Template 1: Flod's cycle detection:
    Let,
X = Distance between the head(starting) to the loop starting point.

Y = Distance between the loop starting point and the first meeting point of both the pointers.

C = The distance of the loop

So before both the pointer meets-
The slow pointer has traveled X + Y + s * C distance, where s is any positive constant number.

The fast pointer has traveled X + Y + f * C distance, where f is any positive constant number.

Since the fast pointer is moving twice as fast as the slow pointer, we can say that the fast pointer covered twice the distance the slow pointer covered. Therefore-                  
 X + Y + f * C = 2 * (X + Y + s * C)

X + Y = f * C – 2 * s * C

We can say that,

f * C – 2 * s * C = (some integer) * C

                         = K * C

Thus,

X + Y = K * C       – ( 1 )

X = K * C – Y        – ( 2 )

Where K is some positive constant.
