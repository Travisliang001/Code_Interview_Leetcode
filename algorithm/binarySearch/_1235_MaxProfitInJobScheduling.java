/*
A. Analyze the what can we solve the problem:
    1. Binary search: there is no easy process to achieve. needs to do internal process and find the relationship between profits and start time.
    2. Greedy algorithm: its wrong if we always procced with the selection with great profit(big profits with long process time)
    3. dp: get the optimal solution from the previous build.
B.
